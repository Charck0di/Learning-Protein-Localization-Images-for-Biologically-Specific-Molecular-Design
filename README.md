The identification of potential bioactive compounds targeting cytosolic skin proteins was pursued using a structure-based virtual screening workflow that integrates image-based protein localization, molecular design, and automated molecular docking. A panel of 25 lead-like small molecules was computationally generated and structurally optimized using semi-empirical PM6 methods. These compounds were then batch converted to 3D PDBQT formats and subjected to automated docking using AutoDock4 against a selected cytosolic skin protein target, specifically the **G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6)**. Due to the absence of a complete receptor structure for GRK3, GRK6 was employed as a surrogate owing to its structural and functional similarity. Grid preparation and docking parameter files were systematically generated using templated scripts, enabling high-throughput ligand screening with consistent settings. Special attention was given to resolving atom-type inconsistencies in the receptor file to ensure accurate grid map generation and docking simulations. This workflow demonstrates an efficient approach to image-guided ligand discovery and prioritization, facilitating downstream biochemical validation.
